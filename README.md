# Final Project Report: FeAsKo

## Preamble
The code source is in the folder Project.
All the files there baring lpeg.so and pt.lua have been entirely written by myself.

### Usage
lua version 5.4.2 or above is recommended. If I remember correctly 5.3 or above is neessary because of changes in file opening syntaxes.

Only test on linux, I have no idea how it plays with Windows filenames for example.

All the commands are to be run from the `Project/` folder, the filename and foldername to be given from 

| name | command(s) | description |
|-|-|-|
| main | `lua main.lua <filename>` | Parses, compiles and runs the designated file as interpreted in the language. In the standard outputs, it prints : the content of the file, the parsed AST, the compiled opcode, the contenet of the file again. It then runs the program which may interact with both the default input and output. Lastly, it prints the stack as it is at the n end of the script execution. |
| input | `lua main.lua ../input` | Main applied to the input program |
| test | `lua tests/test.lua <filename>` <br> `lua tests/test.lua <foldername>/` | Execute (calls main) one or several scripts specified by a motif, decorating the outputs with some additional informations (script name). It waits for the user to press enter between each script. |

## Language Syntax

### Numerals

Numbers are formed roughly the same as in lua : they can be specified in decimal and hexadecimal (prefixed by `0X`), integer or float.
Decimals can also be written in scientific notation (with a whole exponent) using the letter `e`.
Case does not matter.

example of numbers :
```
36
0XAB5B.c3
74.98e78
```

### Basic Expressions

In FeAsKo, most things are expressions.
The basic expressions (arithmetico-logical expressions) are formed by aggregating patterns of decreasing precedence corresponding each to operators and operations.

Here is a table of supported operators in decreasing order of precedence :

| operator | meaning | associativity | remark |
|----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| `^` | power | right |
| `+` <br> `-` | unary plus <br> unary minus | unary | unary operators may be chained but there mus t be space between two consecutive operators
| `//` <br> `*` <br> `/` <br> `%` | floor division <br> multiplication <br> float division <br> modulo | left |
| `+` <br> `-` | plus <br> minus | left | left associativity ensures `a+b-c+d` is correctly parsed as `((a+b)-c)+d`
| `!!` | bitwise not | unary | 
| `>>`  <br> `<<` | right shift <br> left shift | left |
| `&&` | bitwise and | left |
| `~~` | bitwise xor | left |
| `\|\|` | bitwise or | left |
| `<` <br> `>` <br> `<=` <br> `>=` <br> `==` <br> `!=` | lesser than <br> greater than <br> l. or equal <br> g. or equal <br> equal <br> different | special, lazy | `a < b < c` means, `a < b` and `b<c`, but `b` is evaluated only once. Comparison operators can be freely mixed and matched.
| `\|` | not | unary |
| `&` | and | right, lazy |
| `\|` | or | right, lazy |
| `=>` | imply | right, lazy | The logical imply operator. `a => b` is semantically equivalent to `!a or b`
| `=` | assignement | right associative | an assignment evaluates as the value of its right hand side |

Parentheses allows total control over grouping and priorities.

### Sequences

A program in FeAsKo is merely a sequence of expressions to be evaluated.
The program runs from the beginning of the file (no special entry point such as a `main` function).

Expressions are simply separated by spaces, but can also, optionally, be separated by a semicolon followed by a linebreak.

For example,
```
0xAB 5-7 34 << 3
```
is a valid FeAsKo program, athough it's highly recommended to write it :
```
0xAB ;
5-7 ;
34 << 3 ;
```

### Comments and Semicolons

In addition to serving as optional, and sometimes mandatory separators, semicolons are used for comments.

* A semicolons as the first character of a line is the start of a pure comment.
* A semicolons after an expression, on the same line, is an expression separator and the start of a comment
* A semicolons preceded only by space on it's line is undefined behaviour, meaning I know what it does and want it the other way, so don't use it for now.

In a sense, semicolon as separator have the lowest priority, they separate only fully formed expressions.

Comments are delimited as follow :

* A semicolon immediately followed by a sequence of consecutive opening braces `{` is the start of a **group comment**, which last until a sequence of consecutive closing braces `}` in equal number
* A semicolon followed by non opening brace is the start of a **line comment** which last until the end of the line.

For example, `7-3`,
```
7-
3
```
```
7
-3
```
```
7 - 
;the proper way to comment in the middle of an expression
3
```
are all equivalent program. Whereas this :
```
7 - ;
3
```
will cause an error since `7-` is not a valid expression. On the other hand, that :
```
7 ;
-3
```
will cut the expression in two, so as to be equivalent to `7 (-3)`

### Control Flow
If statements are formed as followed :
`if cond exp1`, and with an else :
`if cond exp1 else exp2`

There is no `elseif`, but `else if`achieves the same goal through nesting Ì€`if` without having to materialize the nesting in the code.

For example, the following code
```
if a%2
    if a != 1
        3 * 1 + a
    else
        a // 2
```
 is equivalent to
```
if a%2
    (if a != 1
        3 * 1 + a
    else
        a // 2)
```
and if we want it the other way, we have to write :
```
if a%2
    (if a != 1
        3 * 1 + a)
else
    a // 2
```

You'll observe that the "then" and "else" bodies are expressions.
They are not formula computed in vain, they are actually used to evaluate the if statement.
In fact an if else statement in FeAsKo is exactly a ternary operator.
The snippet :
```
r = (if a 2*a else b)
```
means sensibly the same as, say, the following JavaScript code :
```js
r = a ? 2*a : b ;
```
Without `else`, `if cond exp` is equivalent to `cond & exp`.

`while` syntax follow the same spirit :
`while cond exp` except its evaluation is unspecified (yet).

### Types
FeAsKo is dynamically and very weakly typed.

The four current types are :

* numbers
* Array (which are tables in disguise)
* functions (which are arrays in disguise)
* Nil values, represented by lua nil values. They are generally not supported baring being printed in an array, and should not be used.

For logical operators, the number `0` is false, and everything else is considered true.
When we can't be lazy about hte truthy value an expression evaluates to, such as `!0`, `1` is used to denote true.
The value `nil` is not falsy, and you shouldn't use it.

Did I mention that you shouldn't use nil values ? because you shouldn't.
If you still want to use `nil`, as you shouldn't, 2 current reliable ways to get a `nil` value are :
`{.=()}` (see stack introspection, in new feature / change)
and
`(new[1])[1]`   (see the Array subsection)

The language cruelly lacks type safeguards at the moment and relies entirely on lua.
In particular, equality test of Array and Functions is to be understood as these object being the same, on the same physical location of memory.

### Array
A simple array is declared with the following syntax : 
`new [size]`
Such an array is empty ("filled" wiht nil values, as much as a lua table can be).
The size of the array is checked when trying to get and set values and an error is thrown when the index is out of bound.

```
t = new [3] ;
t [2] = 5 ;
@ = t ;
```

An array can be initialized with the following syntax :
`new [size] = init`
This equal has a special meaning but should follow the same priority and associativity rules as a ssignements (in case of doubt/bug, use parentheses).
The initializing expression is played for each cell of the array to fill.
for example, `t = new [2] = new[3] = 0` will creat a 2 by 3 array filled with zeroes and assign it to `t`. In particular, the 2 rows of `t`, although created the same way, are distinct and changing one won't alter the other.

Chaining the brackets offers a shortcut to create multidimensional arrays, with similar syntax for indexing :

```
a = new [2][2] = 1 ;
a [0][1] = 0 ;
a [1][0] = 0 ;
```

`new [a][b]... = i`
is syntactic sugar for 
`new [a] = new [b]... = i`

### Variables

An **identifier**, or variable name, is a sequences of alphanumerical characters not starting with a digit.

A variable is an optional prefix followed by an identifier.
The prefix dictates the nature of the variable.

* A `~` prefix denotes a global variable.
* A sequence of dots `.` denotes a local variable. See the section *Blocks* for more details. `.` means here, in the current scope, `..` means in the parent scope, `...` in the grand parent scope and so on.
* A sequence of question mark `?` denotes a parameter.See the section **Functions** for more details. Very very roughly, `?` means the caller, `??` the caller's caller and so on.
* Without any prefix, the nature of a variable is inferred at compile time.

Variable need to appear declared before used in the code.
For that they need to be the left hand side of an assignement.
They don't have to actually be initialized, a hacky piece of code such as `0 => (a = 0)` will satisfy the compiler.

Resolving the nature and scope of a prefixless variable is done as follows :
We look for the nearest parameters fitting the name, then the nearest fitting local variable, and last in the global variable.

If nothing is found, a global variable is created if the variable was the left hand side of an assignement, and an error is thrown otherwise.

### IO variable

As a special token behaving like a variable, `@` will, as a left hand side of an assignement, print the expression intead of assigning it.
As a value, it will prompt the user to enter a value, which will replace it.

### List
Another way to separate expressions is using comma.
It does more than that actually, it pushes all the values to the stack while pointing at the first one.
A trailing comma is accepted

```
a = 5, 6,
```
Will assign `5` to `a`.

Comma have a higher priority than `=`and a lower priority than anything else.

Currently, the only intended use of list is within blocks.
In particular, list as left hand side, multiple assignements and multiple value returns are not yet supported.

### Blocks
Blocks are braces-delimited pieces of code, with two special effect :
* Reguarding variables, they create a child scope.
* They create a new stack on which expression are evaluated

At the end of a block, said block evaluates as itself, that is as an array filled with the values left on its stack.

Concretly, blocks can serve as **litteral arrays** :
```
{1, 2, 3}
```
but also
```
{1, {4, 5, 6}, new [3] = 2}
```
and even
```
.c = 4
{
    .a = 5 ;
    .b = 3 ;
    while a = a - 1
        b = 2 * b ;
    b, ..c
}
```
(yields `{48, 4}`)
etc.

A variable may also consist in solely a prefix, without a name.
In that case, it refers to the context itself, or more exactly to its self referring variable.

For example, the following code will print 1 :
```
.a = {..b = .}
@ = a == b
```
The followwing code :
```
@ = {.=3 ;
    4,5,6}
```
will not break, the `.` is only a variable referring by default to the context itself but it can be modified without affecting the block itself.
What it does however, is affect the value yielded, which here will be `3` (and not `{4,5,6}`).

For now, the following codes errors :
```
@ = {.[3] = 5 }
```
Because within itself, the block is considered an array of length zero.
It's only once it closes while `.` has not havng been tempered with that it is interpreted as a litteral array and gets granted a non zero length.

### Functions

The syntax for functions is as follows `# f arg` with a parameter, and `# f ;` or `(# f)` without one.
The semicolon or parentheses is not part of the function per see but I can't recommend them enough to avoid sticking to the next expression.

This pattern has lower precedence over array indexation, meaning `#a[1]` means `#(a[1])`.

To declare a function, use a function pattern as a left side of an assignement.
For example, this
```
# .f = ~a = ~a + 1;
# f;
# f;
```
defines a function which increments the global variable `a` and yields its value, stores it in a local variable, then calls it twice.

The logic behind the notation is loosely inspired from C pointers :
`#a = exp` sets `a` to the value such that `#a` yeilds `exp`.

For now, simple functions can have only a single anonymous parameter (there are non simple functions ahead), referred to as `?`.

For example, the function square is written :
```
# square = ? * ?;
@ = # square 7 ;    prints 49
```

Of course, one possible way to specify several inputs and to have several output is to use arrays :
```
# idiv = {?[1] // ?[2], ?[1] % ?[2]};
@ = # idiv {17, 3} ;
```
There is no unpacking syntax helping destructuring arrays.

A parameter can also be used in a function declaration to specify a default value.
For example :
```
# double 2 = ? + ?;
@ = # double ;      prints 4
@ = # double 6 ;    prints 12
```

Because functions are first class values, and the language is dynamically typed, recursion is both easy and non existant per say, following sort of a global declaration paradigm for recursion and forward declaration.
Indeed, in the following code,
```
# pow2 = if ? 2 * #pow2 (?-1) else 1 ;
@ = # pow2 5 ;
```
`pow2` dos not call it self, rather, it calls the function which is called `pow2`.
The difference can be examplified by the following code :
```
.f = # pow2 = if ? 2 * #pow2 (?-1) else 1 ;
# pow2 = 7 ;
@ = # f 5 ; prints 14 rather than 32
```

A point worthy of mention is that forward declaration is not necessary for simple reccursion.
In the above examples, `f` and `pow2` can alread be used in the rhs of an assignation whose lhs is a function pattern where they appear.

For crossed reduction, the program (the compiler) just needs to know the variable names exist at the moment of declaring the functions.

The same way one can imagine pointers of pointers in C/C++, there are function pattern of function pattern in FeAsKo, denoted :
```
## f p1 p2
```
It is syntactic sugar for 
```
#(# f p1) p2
```
The above syntax may be used both as lhs and rhs, and a left hand side, 
`#(# f p1) p2 = exp` means :
```
# f p1 = (# _  p2 = exp)
```
without the border effect of setting the value of `_`.
That is `f` is the function which returns a function which returns `exp`.

For example :
```
# add 0 = (# _  10 = ?? + ?) ;
@ = # add 3 9 ; 12
@ = # add () 9 ; 9
@ = # add 3 () ; 13
```
Defines the addition, with zero as the first default value and 10 as the second.
`?` has the same meaning as before.
`??` refers to the outer parameter, when looking at it as nested functions.

And other way to conceive it is `?` refers to the last parameters, whereas `??` refers to the inner parameter of the chained function definition.
```
#(# pow 1) = ? ^ ??;        chained definition, parentheses are optional
@ = #(# pow ) 12 ; 12
@ = ## pow 2 5 ; 25
```

This not only gives a somewhat flatter way to provide functions with several parameters, it allows curryfication of sort :
```
## .pow 1 = ? ^ ??;
.id = #pow          ;the identity function
.square = #pow 2    ;the square function
.cube = #pow 3      ;the cube function
```

Oh and by the way, there is a return statement.
It is what you expect.


## New Features/Changes

### A remark on pattern priority and preffix patterns

I added a couple prefixed unary operators (plus, minus, not, but also arguably functions).
An important limitation currently is that we still have to use parentheses according to operator precedence even when the prefixed nature of the pattern makes it unambiguous.

For example, 
```
; unary minus function, using 2-complement
# .minus = 1 + !! ?
```
will yield a syntax error, because `+` has a higher precedence than `!!`.
By contrast, the equivalent lua code
```lua
--unary minus function, using 2-complement
local function minus(a) return 1 + ~ a end
```
is interpreted just fine.

In FeAsKo, for now at least, we have to write :
```
# .minus = 1 + (!! ?)
```

A similar example is the precedence between indexation and function call.
```
# range = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,}
; @ = #range[7] ; errors, as it means #(range[7])
; @ = (#range)[7] ; the current shortest correct syntax.
; @ = #range,[7] ; a desired idiomatic syntax
@ = (#range,)[7]
```
The desired syntax `@ = #range,[7]` errors because list can't be indexed, because it would require them to have higher precedence over indexation rather than lower.

I don't know if there is a purely PEG solution to this issue, but presumably, precedence climbing could solve it.

### Dynamism (indexed and called expressions)
Indexed and function pattern are not limited to variable, they can be used with any expression, which hopefully resolves into a value of correct type at runtime.

Example 1 :
```
{..t =. ;
0, 0, 0, } [2] = 5;
@ = t ; {0, 5, 0}
```

Example 2 :
```
; a mini calculator. It asks for a binary operation, then for it's two operands.
@ = ## {
; 1 for add
    ( ##._= ?? + ? ),
; 2 for minus
    ( ##._= ?? - ? ),
; 3 for multiplication
    ( ##._= ?? * ? ),
; 4 for division
    ( ##._= ?? / ? ),
}[@] @ @

```

### Assignements and order of execution

So far, we've seen that assignements were expressions, which can be right associatively chained.

We've also seen that left hand side could be :
* *a variable*, to assign it.
* *an indexed* expression, to set the value of an array cell.
* *a function pattern* to declare a function.

As a small extra sweet, the left hand side can also be an assignement.
`(@ = 5) = 3`
means `@=5 @=3`

One sizeable issue with enticing users to exotic syntax, other than proucing unleggible code, is that the order in which left hand side and right hand side and their side effect are evaluated is unspecified.
It is a question no matter what, but becomes more visible as fiddling is encouraged.
For now, the order of evaluation has always been taken for convenience, and does not follow any logic or consistency.

### imply operator

The right associative imply operator allows for interesting control flow.
```
.succes = !(treat1 => treat2 => treat3 => 0)
```
It allows to chain treatements that depend on each other.
Because it evaluates as true when its left hand side is falsy, some workaround is necessary to produce sensible output.

It can also, on its own, replace if else, and more generally chains of else if :
```
    (cond1 => exp1 => 0)
=>  (cond2 => exp2 => 0)
=>  (cond3 => exp3 => 0)
; ...
```

Example :
```
SUCCESS = 0

n = @
# Syracuse = (
;prints n and if it is 1 stops
    ((@ = n) == 1 => SUCCESS)
;elseif n is even, multiply it by 3, add 1 and call Syracuse
    => ( n % 2 => (n = 3 * n + 1) => # Syracuse)
;else half n and call Syracuse
    => ( (n = n // 2) => # Syracuse) );

# Syracuse
```

### Iterator Array Init
Because in the initialization of `new[size] = exp` the expression is played once per cell, it allows us to use iterators to initialise arrays.

For example :
```
# range = new [?, (? = ? + 1) ] = (? = ? - 1)
@ = #range 10
```
the function range above creates arrays of a size specified by the parameters, and filled with consecutive integers from 1 to the size of the array.

A major issue is the order in which the expression is player. For now it is played for the last index first, a=out of convenience for me.
Moving forward, it will require thoughts and specifications.

### Scoping
Scoping is a fascinating probelem and a powerful feature.
At the moment, a lot of orginal features seem to work properly, such as `..a` to refer to and possibly declare a local variable in a parent context.

Local variable are statically scoped, meaning functions referring to local variables refer to the variables where they have been defined rather than called. (that's the usual behaviour for popular language nowadays)

I haven't seen any major bug related to scoping, howevr, many things haven't been properly tested yet.

### Blocks and functions
Blocks and functions have great synergy together, this subsection is dedicated to it.

First it's important to mention that functions (or if, or else) by default do not create a new scope.
New scopes are created exactly by brace delimited blocks, with the exception of the whole program itself, which also is its own toplevel scope without requiring braces to materialize (that's what enables writing local variable at top level).

FeAsKo lacks a dedicated syntax for anonymous functions, but the following idioms covers that need :
```
idendtity = {#.= ?}
```
Here, `{#.= ?}` opens a block, defines a function without polluting anynamespace, and yields the function as a value.
Keep in mind that, in order to define new local variables in parent contexts, you'll then one more dot than if you define the function outside a block (if you're only using variable and not using prefixes, it shouldn't change anything).

Encapsulating a function within a block also allows to have persistent local variable, for example :
```
# mem = {
    .nil = ();
    .val = ?;
    #.= if ? == nil val else val = ?
}
a = # mem 3;
@ = #a;     3
@ = #a 7;   7
@ = #a;     7
```

It also allows to make true recursive function, by making the referrence to self unaccessible from the outside (without exploits).

If we take a look back at our previous example :
```
.f = # pow2 = if ? 2 * #pow2 (?-1) else 1 ;
# pow2 = 7 ;
@ = # f 5 ; prints 14 rather than 32
```
and rewrite it using block :

```
.f = pow2 = {#. = if ? 2 * #. (?-1) else 1} ;
# pow2 = 7 ; we can no longer change what the rÃ©cursive function referes to
@ = # f 5 ; 32
```

The syntax `#f = {}` allows to declare function with each call instance having their own scope and local variable, in a way more in line withe mainstream programming languages.

### Stack Introspection and other exploits

The behaviours described in this section are unintended, unsafe, unspecified and unreliable.

They are however a lot of fun and gives idea for the future.
They have to be fixed but, part of them may become features.

Stack introspection has accidentally been made possible, as a result of me being lazy when it comes to cleaning the stack (only changing the pointer without erasing the content).
Combined with the fact that most things are expression that are evaluated and pushed to the stack even when not necessarilly used, and combined with some bridges otherwise leading to nowhere it offers some intersting options.
```
45, 52;
@ = a = ();         prints 45
@ = b = 0 + ();     print 52

72;
@ = c = {.=()}  ;   nil. 
;Some things, such as closing a block, forces the cleansing of the stack.
;The opening of a block itself result in a fresh stack
;Supposedly, function returns also clean the stack
```
It may open some hacks to code functions with multiple returns.

Function inspections and code injection :
```
.nil = ()

#f = 5 ;

@= f
@= f[2] ;nil
@ = #f ; 5

f[2] = 63

@= f
@= f[2] ; 63
@ = #f;  63

f[2] = nil

@= f
@= f[2] ; nil
@ = #f;  5
```
Internally, the static body of a function is an akin to an array with some fluff.
Here, the array corresponding to `f` is :
`{'write', 5, 'ret'}`.

Because function values are only proxies of a static body with some fluff (the same static body may for example correspond to several values, possibly with differing default param value), and because of how array inspection works, one cannot inspect the static body of a function at runtime.
Trying to will yields nil or error depending on the index nd size of the funciton body

It is however possible to inject code into the proxy and shadow the static body, which is what is happening in the code above

## Future

The main gaping holes which would absolutely need to be filled before thinking about production are
* better framework
    * automatic test.
    * better interface, command line for now. Option to only parse, only compile, run a precompiled code ... Better ways to specify input, ways to specify outputs.
    * much better error and warning reports, including type checking
* Fixing things in the interpreter
    * sanitize the stack
    * clarify how much functions (and more generally context) introspection and alteration is permitted and act accordingly.
* New Language feature
    * clarify the value yielded by while
    * break statement, similar to return but for blocks
    * strings
    * handling nil values properly

The above would be necessary to make an appaaling prototype.

For production, :
* framework
    * think about portability and packaging.
    * some documentation
* Core
    * pondering about memory allocation
    * Rewrite the virtual machine in Java/Kotlin | Rust | C/C++/D, mostly depending on choices for memory allocation.
    As a register machine ideally.
    * precedence climbing.
    * ponder transpilation into a popular language ??
* New Language feature
    * named parameters
    * tuple assignement and/or destructuring pattern if deemed relevant.
    * some sort of context manipulation, ways to dynamically reopen blocks.
    It opens question about variable mapping, dictionary or not, etc.
    * some sort of minimal prototypal OO ? Ideally leveraging context, functional programming and introspection.
    * File manipulation

For the very far future
* tail recursivity
* Ponder and improve assignements, order of evaluations...
* Promises
* online playground
* browser integration
* switch cases

## Self assessment

| Criteria | Score | Explanation |
|-|-|-|
| **Language Completeness** | 3 | All exercices treated, if some exotically, as well as two of the proposed feature : ternary operators and bitwise operator (challenging). Numerous self imposed challenge also taken, mainly first class functions and scopes. |
| **Code Quality and Report** | 2 | I think I barely tick every box of "meet expectations" on this one, but in a way very lacklusting and hindering considering the size of the project, a 1 wouldn't surprise me. |
| **Originality and Scope** | 3 | I went above and beyond, and surely too far for my own good. Regarding modularity, the proposed extra features were easily added as an afterthought, despite one being considered challenging. |
