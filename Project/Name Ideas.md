# BAPL2
A programming language being created at the occasion of the "build a progamming language" course from Calsspert with Roberto Lerusalimschy

## Name ?
# Lorimar
# £fE_asKo

Ultimately, I'd love to build a language similar to lua (maybe a superset) especially on the OOP and functional part, but with built-in Promises and a built in scheduler like in JS. In particular, a bunch of way to use promises like regular variable without having to write and ugly await every time.
With possibility of code injection for any of those languages (so that I don't have to implement everything, but at the cost of having to transform data, so idk. but most importantly I guess so that people familiar with either can use them)

But with syntax thought out for these uses (Promise, OOP), and, for fun, some crazy syntax and behaviour reguarding identifier resolution.

So Lorimar and Fe-As-Ko would be litterary references to work of art called or adapted as "promise the moon". It's both too ambitious, and invloves lua and promises. In what I'm envisioning, £fE_asKo would be a lazy indentifier/awaiting (lvalue/rvalue, similar to * in C or pointers) a promise whose value is of type (global) FE

## Just Strings

troll name playing on js which also stand for the already confusedly named JavaScript. The gimmick could be that strings are callables. Could be interesting with dynamic syntax ala Metalua (also daunting).
